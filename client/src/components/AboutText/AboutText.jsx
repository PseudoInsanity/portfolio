                    <strong>Who am I?</strong>
                    <br />
                        I am 23 years old, stationed in Malm√∂, and I just graduated from the Computer Science program at Kristianstad University.
                        I enjoy making order out of chaos and I always try to learn what I can from what I have.
                        <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Why choose me?</strong>
                    <br />
                        Although I'm not a very experienced coder, I do take a lot of pride in my curiosity, and as my own biggest critic, I always wish to improve myself.
                        <br />
                        I also believe that my social skills is what sets me apart and what makes me a great fit for you. I do believe that communication is very important in a professional environment and being able to communicate with anyone is equally as important as being able to program.
